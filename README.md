# 📈 Advertising Data Analysis - Multiple Linear Regression

This project explores how advertising budgets across different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) impact sales performance using multiple linear regression.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using the popular `Advertising.csv` dataset, this analysis aims to:

- Understand the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales
- Build a multiple linear regression model
- Evaluate the model’s performance with various metrics and visualizations

## 📁 Files

- `Advertising - Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full data analysis and model training.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Summary statistics
   - Correlation heatmaps
2. **Data Visualization**
   - Scatter plots between features and target variable
3. **Model Building**
   - Multiple Linear Regression using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - RMSE and MAE
   - Residual plots

## 📌 Insights

- TV and Radio have significant effects on sales.
- Newspaper spending shows less impact.
- The final model helps predict sales based on given advertising budgets.

## 📈 Business Application

This model can guide companies on how to allocate advertising budgets efficiently across different media to maximize sales outcomes.
